# IBM HR EMPLOYEE ATTRITION

## SUMMARY 
Employees don’t just leave a company; they leave for different reasons.

In this IBM HR Employee Attrition data analysis, I aimed to uncover the most probable causes of attrition within the company and explore if there are any correlations between attrition and the available variables.

Here’s what I found:

Out of 1,470 employees, 237 left the company, resulting in an attrition rate of 16.12%. While more males left compared to females, 
this could be due to their relative high representation in the company.  males aged 18-20, especially those with less than a year of stay in the company, 
were more likely to leave. the chances of them leaving increases when they are 
working with a particular manager and their satisfaction rating is one and also working as sales rep or HR.

Although no strong linear correlations were identified among the variables, Distance from Home showed a slight positive trend—indicating that, 
the more the distance of an employee from the company is, the higher the chances of the person leaving the company.

Key influencers reveal that employees with less than two Total Working Years, with monthly income less than 2,800 dollar, or low job satisfaction rating of 1 are two to three times more likely to leave.

These insights highlight that attrition is driven by a complex combination of factors, including the number of years spent in the company, compensation, satisfaction, and managerial relationships,
 rather than a single variable.
